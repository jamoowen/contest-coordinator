# contest-coordinator

This is a backend designed to help people set up and and organize a tournament based on a number of players and a 1v1 tournament format where the winner advances.

The initial requirements for this project are the following: 
    - Register players for a tournament
    - Record the outcomes of matchups between two players
        - Win
        - Lose
        - Draw
        - Void (Matchup was cancelled)
    - Add a capability to rank who did the best out of those players.
    + Add a capability for generating matchups
    + Indicate schedule with time intervals between matches

*Need to document how to run the project (In this readme ideally)
*Must implement testing (ideally jest, else vitest)
